# About Me

I am Shayan Shafiee Moghadam, an aspiring researcher with a strong academic foundation in **Compouter and Industrial Engineering** and a focus on addressing complex problems through **system optimization** and data-driven methodologies.

I earned my **Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering** from the **University of Tehran**, where I cultivated a robust understanding of engineering principles and analytical problem-solving techniques. I further advanced my academic pursuits by completing a **Master’s degree in System Optimization** (also at the **University of Tehran**), during which I specialized in **developing advanced optimization models and metaheuristic algorithms**. My research addressed challenging problems in supply chain management, including **facility location-inventory systems, closed-loop network design, and dynamic routing-inventory problems**, with a particular emphasis on **uncertainty modeling, disruption management, and multi-objective decision-making**. My work spanned diverse industries, such as e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods, and healthcare, providing practical solutions to real-world challenges.

In addition to my academic achievements, I gained substantial industry experience as a **Software Engineer** and **Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst** at **Hamravesh Cloud** and **Digikala E-commerce**. In these roles, I applied my technical expertise to **analyze real-world data, implement machine learning algorithms, and develop data-driven decision-making tools** using mathematical modeling and dashboard visualization. I also contributed to the design and implementation of **production-ready, reliable software systems**, gaining hands-on experience in **system architecture, software engineering principles, and scalable system development**.

Following the completion of my Master’s degree, I fulfilled my **2-year mandatory military service**, which accounts for the gap between my studies and my current pursuit of a **PhD**. I am now eager to return to academia, where I aim to contribute to **cutting-edge research** and develop innovative solutions to complex, real-world problems.
