Water scarcity is one of the most important issues in the world today. Given the limited withdrawal of water resources and the increase in its consumption at the national level, one of the important risks for the future generation in Iran is the problem of shortage of drinking and consumable water. Water consumption is generally classified into 3 sections: agricultural consumption, industrial consumption, and domestic consumption. In this article, only domestic consumption and people's consumption patterns will be examined. In this regard, this research has attempted to present a model to examine the water consumption pattern in Iran using the concepts of dynamic systems modeling. After examining the accuracy and correctness of the model, using data from previous years, the effect of water bill amounts and the media on people's awareness in modeling has been examined. Finally, methods and solutions have been proposed to improve the water consumption pattern in Iran. The results indicate that the use of two policies, incentive plans and hopeful advertisements, has a significant impact on improving the system's performance and, as a result, correcting the water consumption pattern.
