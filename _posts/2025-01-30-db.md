Recently, I watched two insightful lectures by Martin Kleppmann which deepened my understanding of database scaling. Inspired by these talks and drawing from my own experience, I decided to write about various scaling options for databases, framing the discussion as a self-interview to explore the practical solutions Iâ€™ve applied and learned along the way.
