I recently read [this](https://www.dbos.dev/blog/what-is-lightweight-durable-execution) article about a lightweight durable execution solution called DBOS. Meanwhile, I was working heavily with Temporal, a well-known open-source tool for durable executions. Technically, both serve the same purpose, but with major differences:

Temporal is heavyweight. To run it, you need a Temporal cluster, a database connected to the cluster, one or more Temporal workers, the Temporal UI, and finally, the Temporal SDK to trigger workflows from your application. On the other hand, DBOS is lightweight and requires only a database to store its data. The workflow runs within the same application that includes the DBOS library, whereas in Temporal, workflows run on separate resources called workers. Essentially, DBOS is a library, while Temporal is a full-fledged software solution that you interact with via its SDKs.

Temporal is an external orchestration solution written in Golang, with support for multiple languages through its SDKs. However, DBOS libraries are only available in TypeScript and Python, and I'm not sure whether they offer the same features in both languages.

Temporal encourages a microservices architecture. While it's possible to use it differently, Temporal is best suited for a microservices-based system, making it a great choice for structured, scalable organizations. You can even have workflows distributed across multiple services (workers), each with its own stack and language, and Temporal makes it work seamlessly. On the flip side, DBOS does not support multi-language or distributed architectures, as it runs entirely within your code. This makes it perfect for small-sized applications with no dependencies on external services or components.

|Aspect |	DBOS (Lightweight Durable Execution) | Temporal (Heavyweight Durable Execution)|
|---|---|---|
|Architecture |	Implements durable execution as a library that is directly integrated into your application. No separate orchestrator is required. | Uses an external orchestrator/worker model. Workflows are defined as separate steps executed by distinct worker services coordinated by the Temporal server.|
|Operational Complexity |	Lightweight setup – you write ordinary functions decorated for durability. Recovery and persistence occur within the same process, reducing deployment and testing friction. | More heavyweight – requires running separate orchestrator and worker servers. This adds complexity in terms of deployment, scaling, and debugging.|
|State Persistence | Persists workflow state, step outputs, and execution metadata to Postgres. Recovery is done by re-running workflows deterministically using the stored state.| Persists workflow state externally, typically in a dedicated datastore managed by the Temporal service. Recovery is orchestrated by the Temporal server based on previously completed steps.|
|Determinism Requirement |	Requires workflows to be deterministic so that repeated executions (e.g. on recovery) follow the same steps in the same order.	| Also requires deterministic workflows to ensure that replaying events leads to consistent state and behavior.|
|Developer Experience |	Designed to be simple: you write standard Python (or TypeScript) functions and “decorate” them. No need to manage a separate orchestration infrastructure.| Involves writing workflows as orchestrated steps and managing interactions via the Temporal client and service. The separation of orchestration and worker logic introduces extra overhead.|
|Extensibility and Features|	Built with a focus on additional features (durable sleep, durable messaging, durable queues) directly integrated into the library.|	Offers a rich set of features, but these are delivered as part of the broader orchestration system, which can sometimes feel over-engineered for simple use cases.|
|Deployment|	Runs within the same process as your application. Deployment is straightforward, similar to any standard library integration.|	Requires managing distributed components – the Temporal server and worker processes need to be deployed, monitored, and maintained separately.|
|Fault Tolerance|	On process restart, a background recovery thread replays workflows from the last persisted step using the Postgres store.|	The Temporal orchestrator handles workflow recovery by tracking and re-dispatching incomplete tasks based on its persistent history, providing robust fault tolerance in distributed setups.|
|Use Case Fit|	Ideal for applications needing durable execution without the complexity of distributed orchestration – e.g. simple workflows or lightweight background tasks.|	Well-suited for complex, distributed workflows where isolation between orchestration and execution is beneficial, but may be overkill for simpler use cases.|

These were my thoughts after reading the article. I'd love to hear yours!
